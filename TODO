Implement User Authentication and Permissions:

We want to grant the DM complete control over everything but need to make sure users
can't access, change or remove certain data (specifically other users' data)

Routes to be protected:
/encounters/
Encounter data should only be visible to the DM.

/characters/
Character data should only be visible to the DM.

Player Clients need to be able to create new Characters,
patch their own characters (e.g. add conditions, change hp, etc.)
and delete their own characters (this is low priority at the moment)

We can think of allowing players to see other players' HP but
I think players should only be able to see their own HP

/initiatives/
Initiative data should only be visible to the DM.

/users/
User data should be visible to DM (however there's not much
functionality for DM here)
